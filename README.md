# Calculator
This is my attempt to make a simple calculator without researching how to do so.

# Requirments:

  -Make a basic calculator that can store memory of all past calculations, which the user can then use to revert to a past calculated integer.                           
  
  -Have Passive user alerts when a incorrectly formatted equation was inputed.


# OutCome:

  -The Agile Methodology was use during this project. I focused first on getting a stable simple calculator. Afterwards i begain building rules to delegate its mathamatical use. 
  
  -My calculator uses a complex method of string, to integer, and back to string. This allows me to extract equation symbols and decimals with ease, split up both parts     of a calculation for precise logging, and to have more strict rules/usecases for user input equation formatting. It was for these reasons i made it with this method.
